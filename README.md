# imagihub_server
This a nodejs/express server for imagihub image sharing web app 
  @ [imagihub](https://imagihub.yaredb.tech) or [imagihub](https://imagihub.yaredb.net.et)
  
We are living in a digital world, but the hustle to just send an image,

You need to login
You must use same social media
The image is compressed
You need to share it to every one or create a group
Most of the time you need android
There are a ton of solutions for this. I just want to contribute to the cause, make an alternative easy way of sharing images.
